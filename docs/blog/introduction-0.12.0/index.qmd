In Great Tables `0.12.0` we did something that is sure to please those who obsess over styling, and this is the ability to style virtually any part (i.e., *location*) of a table. Also, the use of *Google Fonts* is now integrated into the package (with lots of font choices there). Lastly, we incorporated row striping as an option so that you can get that zebra stripe look in your table. In this post, we'll present a few examples in the following big features:

- using `tab_style()` in more `locations=`
- putting some Google Fonts into a table with `tab_style()`/`opt_table_font()` + `google_font()`
- adding row stripes with `tab_options()` or `opt_row_striping()`

### Styles all over the table with an enhanced `loc` module

Before `v0.12.0` we were able to style parts of the table with `tab_style()` but that was limited only to the body of the table by having only `loc.body()` being usable in `tab_style()`'s `locations=` argument. Now, we have quite a few locations that cover all locations in the table! Here's the complete set:

- `loc.body()` - the table body
- ...


Let's start with this small, yet unstyled table. It has a few locations included thanks to its use of several `tab_*()` methods.

```{python}

#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

from great_tables import GT, exibble, style, loc


gt_tbl = (
    GT(exibble.head(), rowname_col="row", groupname_col="group")
    .cols_hide(columns=["fctr", "date", "time"])
    .tab_header(
        title="A small piece of the exibble dataset",
        subtitle="Displaying the first five rows (of eight)",
    )
    .tab_source_note(
        source_note="This dataset is included in Great Tables."
    )
)

gt_tbl
```


```{python}
from great_tables import GT, exibble, style, loc

(
    gt_tbl
    .tab_style(
        style=style.fill(color="lightblue"),
        locations=loc.body(columns="num", rows=[1, 2]),
    )
    .tab_style(
        style=[
            style.text(color="white", weight="bold"),
            style.fill(color="olivedrab")
        ],
        locations=loc.body(columns="currency")
    )
    #.tab_style(
    #    style=style.fill(color="aqua"),
    #    locations=[
    #        loc.column_labels(columns=["num", "currency"]),
    #        loc.title(),
    #        loc.subtitle()
    #    ]
    #)
)
```





### Using fonts from Google Fonts



### Striping rows in your table



### Wrapping up

We got a lot of feedback on how limiting table styling was so we're happy that enhanced styling is now released with `v0.12.0`. If you're new to the wide world of table styling, check out the [*Get Started* guide on styling the table](https://posit-dev.github.io/great-tables/get-started/basic-styling.html) for primer on the subject. As ever, please let us know through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/posit-dev/great-tables/issues) whether you ran into problems with any feature (new or old), or, if you have suggestions for further improvement!
