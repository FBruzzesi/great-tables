The recent `v0.3.1` and `v0.4.0` releases of **Great Tables** contain a lot of useful new features! We want to highlight just five of the more notable features within this post:

1. nanoplots via `fmt_nanoplot()`
2. improved HTML table representations in different code environments
3. integration of Polars selectors in the `columns=` arg of all formatting (`fmt_*()`) methods
4. the `save()` method for saving a **GT** table as an image file
5. rendering a **GT** table as an HTML string though `as_raw_html()`

This is all really exciting stuff so let's review each of these features in some detail!

### Nanoplots, small interactive plots in your table



### Better HTML table representations, especially in VScode



### Column selection in `fmt_*()` methods via Polars selectors



### Using `.save()` to get an image of a table



### Obtaining the raw HTML output of a table (`as_raw_html()`)



### Wrapping up

These releases are quite exciting to us and we're so happy these features are available for everyone to use.
