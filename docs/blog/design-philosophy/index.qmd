When thinking about tables and the qualities that make tables both informative and aesthetically please, it's all to easy to lose sight of the fundamentals. We ought to understand what makes a table a table, what characteristics make tables shine, and when to choose tables over other displays of information like plots. Throughout this post I'll try to address all of this and I'll also delve into the little-discussed history of tables to see where this all came from. Once we're back to the here and now, there will be some elaboration on what **Great Tables** brings to the table. The package has a clear vision and design philosophy and I hope to articulate all of that here.

### What is a table, really?

Tables are surpisingly hard to define! I think it's that we take them for granted and we don't often question those tables that are presented to us in terms of their fundamental characteristics. Still, it is useful to understand what makes a table a table. I believe it can be boiled down to two basic rules:

- data is placed in a grid comprising columns and rows
- the data is primarily in the form of text, and the text can include both numbers and words

This set of requirements seems like the bare minimum for a table to be construed as a table. If we have one without the other, then what results is something probably not recognizable as a table. I know that we often see and use horizontal and/or vertical grid lines within tables, but, those act more as visual reinforcements that outline the columns and rows. So, they're not strictly required for a table to be one. And if this reasoning holds it is thus the arrangement of the data values that matters most here (and not the presence of lines, which serves to visualize the underlying grid).

Now let's address each of the two rules, starting with the first that involves columns and rows. What goes in each? The most effective tables will have separate entries or records arranged as the horizontal rows; and the characteristics or attribute values run down columns. The intersecting piece of text (sometimes called a cell, but not always) is a data attribute tied to a specific record or entry. This is intuitive because we're used to seeing tables (they've been around for thousands of years!) but we don't often rigorously think about how this all works. Let's look at an example of a simple table to tie the theory to practice.

```{python}
# | echo: false
import polars as pl
from great_tables import GT, md

simple_table = pl.DataFrame(
    {
        "Name": [
            "Dustin B. Roach",
            "Iwona Adamczyk",
            "Geneviève Massé",
            "João Souza Lima",
            "Maddison McCabe",
        ],
        "Address": [
            "1183 Columbia Road",
            "ul. Zabłudowska 133",
            "1415 rue Principale",
            "Rua Cosmorama, 538",
            "149 Raymond Street",
        ],
        "City": ["Holly Oak, DE", "Warszawa", "Amos, QC", "São Paulo-SP", "Strathern"],
        "Postcode": ["19809", "04-788", "J9T 1E4", "04648-080", "Invercargill 9812"],
        "DOB": ["1970-09-16", "1976-01-03", "1967-12-08", "2001-04-21", "1982-03-05"],
        "Height": ["5' 9\"", "5' 5\"", "5' 3\"", "6' 2\"", "5' 8\""],
        "Weight": [202.5, 123.7, 136.3, 231.0, 146.1],
    }
)

GT(simple_table)
```

Each row in the table corresponds to a single person. Starting from the left we see people's names and so we can surmise that these are records that pertain to individuals. Each column provides some attribute of the person, which includes the full name, address details, date of birth, and some physical characteristics. For the columns in this table we don't have to infer what type of data is contained in each from the data itself, a row at the top is dedicated for labeling the contents within the columns.

We'll go into much more detail later about how to best arrange information and how to adorn the table with more structural elements. For now, let's go back in time to learn how tables evolved.

### The early history of tables

Another aspect of tables that has the power to surprise is just how long they've been around. The earliest known examples go very far back in human history. I did mention the word *grid* a few times and there is much evidence for grids predating tables. So really, the history of graphical representation and of data analysis begins with the grid. Could we break down the idea of a grid? Sure, it's a metric by which we establish distance and direction of any position relative to a reference point, line, or plane. Some examples include geographic mapping with latitiude and longitude measures, and, the regular arrangement of city blocks through the arrangement of east-west and north-south streets. The latter is commonly known as a square grid and this is the sense of a grid we'll use going forward.

Twenty-five thousand year old representations of the grid are found on the walls of the Lascaux and Niaux caves in France[^1]. In the second century BCE, the highly regarded Greek astronomer Hipparchus used latitude and longitude to locate celestial and terrestrial positions[^2]. At around AD 150, Ptolmey published *Geographia*, which contains 25 geographical maps accompanied by methodologies for their construction using grids[^3]. The Romans employed a grid system called centuration, which can be described as land measurement (using surveyors' instruments) to realize the formation of square grids using roads, canals, or agricultural plots[^4].

When grids are made, you invariably generate containers; these are locations that may hold some sort of information. When agriculture because more widespread (ca. 10,000 years ago), there was the need to document and manage economic transactions to do with to farming, livestock, and the division of labor. In the fourth millennium BCE, Mesopotamian cities that traded with geographically distant kingdoms certainly needed to keep such records. We have evidence for these accounting practices by way of clay tablets recovered from the ancient Sumerian city of Uruk. Here is drawing of one of the recovered tablets, which contains an accounting of deliveries of barley and malt from two individuals for the production of beer.

![](./uruk_iii_tablet.png)

The inscribed grid in the ca. 3200-3000 BCE tablet creates boxes and each one of them represented an accounting unit. Inside each box was an ideogram (a symbol that represented a word or idea) and a numerical value representing a quantity. Now here is where it gets super interesting: each row corresponds to an individual, two columns contain entries for malt and barley; subtotals are given in the third column; and the left-most box displays the grand total. This has all the elements of a summary table! In addition, no formal language was used to explain the relationships within the tablet/table. Instead, the grid structure itself provided all that. As a bonus, the table has a footer as the bottom row contains the name of the official in charge. This is a visionary table we've got here.

Zooming ahead about a thousand years, you start to see more systematically structured tables. Here's a photo of a cuneiform tablet that was originally from Mesopotamia (from the Temple of Enlil at Nippur, ca. 1850 BCE).

![](./nippur_cuneiform_tablet.png)

You can see right away that there is a more regular grid and, if you probe deeper, there are more similarities than differerences with the tables of today. This contains sources of revenue and monthly disbursements for nearly 50 temple personnel. While it can be difficult to see it, you should take it on good authority[^5] that the following table elements are present:

- column headings (month names) and row titles (names/professions of individuals).
- cells with no information (look at the blank or smooth cells along rows)
- numerical values in the cells
- subtotals for each individual are every six months
- grand totals adjacent to row labels
- annotations with explanatory notes under those columns containing totals

Later on, tables were less inscribed on clay and more on wax tablets, papyrus, paper, and eventually tables became computerized. What a trip it has been for tables!

### Midcentury tables

There's a prehistory to modern, computerized tables and perhaps the best period for tables was around the middle of the 20th century. Technologies for table (and surrounding document) preparation included the offset printer, the typewriter, and varitype[^6] (my favorite). While constrained by the limited space available on pages, tabular design at this point had many solutions for either fitting tables onto single, variously-sized pages or distributing the table content across multiple pages. Ever heard of 'Multipage Narrow, Continuous Boxhead' tables? How about the 'Broad Table'? The 'Parallel Table'? I'm sure you've seen these types of tables but just didn't know the names.

To remedy this lack of knowledge on table typologies, the United States Bureau of the Census published their *Manual of Tabular Presentation*[^7]. While intended as an operating tool (what might be called a style guide nowadays) one can plumb the considerable depths of this monograph for its excellent recommendations on tabular design. It spares no detail on how to classify the different parts of a table, it provides many examples in visual form, and it provides hundreds of recommendations on what to do (and what *not* to do) for many tabulation scenarios. We, **Great Tables**, borrow liberally from this work because many of its tabular design principles are just as good now as they were back then (and we'll talk about what we took from that work in the next section). If you're interested in really getting into the nitty gritty of tabular presentation then [get the freely-available PDF file](https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/1949/general/tabular-presentation.pdf) and prepare to be delighted. We'll end this brief section with a visual montage of snippets from the *Census Manual*, which is laden with good advice.

![](./snippets_from_manual_tablular_presentation.png)

### Approach to tables taken by **Great Tables**

As mentioned in the previous section, the *Census Manual* had a profound impact on the design of the **Great Tables** API. We decided to borrow some of the naming conventions for the table components since not having names for such things would have made explications in the documentation quite awkward. In the *Census Manual* spirit of making things visual, we often try to visually present how the table components fit together with a unifying graphic. Here's one example of that:

![](./composition_of_a_table_in_GT.png)

If you followed our advice to look at the *Census Manual* (or just glanced at our excerpts-based graphic), you might have noticed that the term 'Stub' is also in our table schematic. We thought it was too good a name to *not* borrow. You won't find too many mentions of that term elsewhere; others in the table business will use it sparingly, if at all. But that bit of terminology is perfect for the function that component has: to store information that identifies and explains the rows (as well as labels that deal with groupings of rows). The table 'Heading' is all important to us, and far too many software applications that allow for summary table creation make it difficult or impossible to include a heading.

Aside from similarities in naming conventions, we wanted to be different and really focus on the art of generating summary tables. Many table APIs (built with all sorts of programming languages) almost exclusively concern themselves with the simple display of records (with pagination and other such controls to navigate and filter hundreds, thousands, maybe even more records). And that is great for situations where you want to expose a database of records for a user to explore. But we wanted to go the other way and help the user that wanted to exclusively focus on smaller data, sometimes called summarized or summary data. This is typically what you see in journal articles, in books, and in [*The Economist*](https://www.economist.com/economic-and-financial-indicators/2024/03/14/economic-data-commodities-and-markets). There's that unaddressed need to create a highly customized table-as-interesting-visualization that needed to be filled.

That very first table we showed here was to teach you what a table is (as if you don't know!) but I suppose it could also serve as an example of a very simple table, a starting point if you will. Let's take that and use the **Great Tables** API to make that table really shine. We'll add table components with the `tab_*()` methods, format some data with the `fmt_*()` methods, and customize the look of the table with some `opt_*()` methods. Here goes:

```{python}
from great_tables import GT, md, system_fonts

(
    GT(simple_table, rowname_col="Name")
    .tab_spanner(label="Location", columns=["Address", "City", "Postcode"])
    .tab_spanner(label="Personal Characteristics", columns=["DOB", "Height", "Weight"])
    .tab_options(table_font_size="12px")
    .tab_header(title="Names, Addresses, and Characteristics of Remote Correspondents")
    .tab_source_note(source_note=md("*Data last updated*: December 18, 2022."))
    .fmt_date(columns="DOB", date_style="m_day_year")
    .fmt_integer(columns="Weight", pattern="{x} lbs")
    .opt_stylize()
    .opt_align_table_header(align="left")
    .opt_vertical_padding(scale=0.75)
    .tab_options(
        table_font_names=system_fonts(name="rounded-sans"),
        table_font_size="14px"
    )
)
```

You're always free to use as little or as much of the available API methods to iteratively modify the table to your liking. For our part, we'll endeavor to keep the semantics consistent and the API easy to understand and to use. And across the API surfaces of table structuring, cell formatting, styling, and output there's a lot of room for growth, so, we'll keep plugging away at all that work too. We measure success by the quality of the tables the package is able to produce. We're excited about where things are going with this and we always appreciate community feedback.
